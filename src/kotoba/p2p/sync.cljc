(ns kotoba.p2p.sync
  "P2P graph-sync protocol for kotoba's content-addressed commit chains —
  pure state machine, transport injected.

  Composes the layers below it instead of re-implementing them:

    - `kotoba.net.gossip`   — announce routing: content-hash dedup +
                              deterministic fanout (GossipSub semantics);
    - `kotoba.net.bitswap`  — `commits-since` delta over the commit log
                              (WantSince semantics);
    - `commit-dag.core`     — chain walk + tamper/seq verification;
    - `kotoba-client`       — CID-verified block ingest and the generic
                              tag-42 missing-blocks walk (`ipld-hydrate`).

  The tag-42 migration is what makes this protocol small: chain prev,
  snapshot state, index roots and tree children are all REAL IPLD links,
  so \"sync a graph\" collapses to \"hydrate the announced head CID to
  convergence, then `verify-chain`\". There is no per-schema transfer
  logic anywhere in this namespace.

  Purity contract: every handler is `(node, msg) -> {:node node'
  :effects [{:to peer-id :msg m} ...]}`. The ONLY side effects go through
  the node's injected `:store` ports (`put!`/`get-fn` — the same
  convention prolly-tree/commit-dag use); the transport that delivers
  `:effects` is entirely the host's (see `kotoba.p2p.loopback` for the
  in-memory reference transport). No sockets, no crypto handshake, no
  wire framing here — a QUIC/WebRTC/WebTransport adapter is a host
  follow-up, not this namespace's job.

  Trust model: blocks are CID-verified on ingest (a lying peer's bytes
  are skipped, never stored), and a head is only adopted after
  `verify-chain` passes over fully-local blocks. A peer that withholds
  or corrupts blocks can stall sync (liveness), never corrupt state
  (safety) — the same split the browser read-plane ADR records: trust
  lives in the CID, not the transport. Head-record *signing* (proving an
  announce came from the graph owner) is CACAO's job and a tracked
  follow-up, mirroring kotoba-client's IPNS-verification gap."
